# BrainTumorSegmentation
Final Bsc project, semanting segmentaion of brain tumor from MRI scans using deep learning.

Brain tumor is a state in which cells form in an abnormal way and without supervision.
In order to evaluate the diseaseâ€™s progression and give suitable treatment a 3D MRI scan is used. In current clinical routine, the resulting images are evaluated based on qualitative criteria manually.
In this project we will developed an optimal algorithm using neural networks for segmenting Glioma tumors from MR images

Using the BRATS2012 dataset (http://braintumorsegmentation.org).
